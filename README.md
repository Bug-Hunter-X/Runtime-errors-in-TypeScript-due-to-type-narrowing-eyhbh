This repository demonstrates a common error in TypeScript: the potential for runtime errors even when using type annotations.  The `bug.ts` file showcases the error, where the division function can potentially throw a runtime error despite having type safety. The `bugSolution.ts` file shows a solution that handles the error more effectively using try-catch blocks.  The example focuses on type narrowing and runtime error handling in TypeScript. This is a fundamental issue for developers learning to build robust applications using TypeScript.
